# FiniteStateMachine2QStabSubtheory

A finite state machine implementation of the contextual psi-epistemic model of the 2 qubit stabilizer subtheory.

The model has been implemented in mathematica 10.x+, due to the in built graphical representations provided by mathematica. All documentation on the usage of the code can be found within the notebook.

Additionally a pdf detailing the mathematical underpinning of the beta-function in the binary sympletic representation has been included for reference.

Note: Versions of mathematica prior to 10.x should be compatible, however the initialization start up provided by the code may be non-fucntional.
